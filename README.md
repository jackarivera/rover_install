## Rover Toolbox	

*Successor to the old [rover_tools_ros2](https://github.com/RoverRobotics/rover_tools_ros2). This installer provides many upgrades over the previous script, listed below.*

This toolbox is now slated to have more features than just an installer. The goal is to have a ROS2 installer portion, Rover installer portion, and a robot toolbox. 

The ROS2 installer will handle automated installs of ROS2 distros.

The Rover installer will handle the install of rover robot software and related packages.

The Robot Toolbox will have all sorts of features from configuring settings to launching nodes and even viewing robot data.

All of this will be through a terminal user interface which means all of these tools can be accessed through ssh with a "graphical" interface.

> :warning: This installer is not yet finished and may have no functionality or unforeseen consequences if used to install a robot at this point. Proceed with caution!
